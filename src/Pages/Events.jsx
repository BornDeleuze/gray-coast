        <h1>The Guildhall hosts a wide variety of events – from music and theater performances, to movie screenings, presentations and discussions, author readings, clothing swaps, skill shares, open mics, and more! Our public events are open to all ages, and are either free or by donation or sliding scale – noone turned away for lack of funds. There is no alcohol allowed at public events.

We have a house sound system and basic theater lighting, and can seat around 100 people at maximum capacity.

Events are hosted by Guildhall volunteers who have been oriented on how to run events, work the lights and sound, and manage other event details. Because of this, our ability to host events depends entirely on the interest and availability of our volunteers!

For more information about performing at the Guildhall, or being trained to host events as a volunteer, reach out to events.graycoastguildhall@gmail.com

The Guildhall is also open to private rentals for those looking to host closed events such as youth camps, private gatherings, music lessons, weddings, and more. Contact graycoastguildhall@gmail.com for more information about private rental policies and fees.
